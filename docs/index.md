Oraclaestus
================

Oraclaestus is an open-source entity simulator.
Its aims to provide a simple environment for simulating entities, their behaviors and their interactions along the time.
Entities can be assets, devices, or even software components.
This simulator is primarily designed to be used in test environments as a companion of the software to test,
by simulating the behavior of the software's dependencies.


Getting started
================

<TODO: Add a quick intro and link to the getting started guide>


File types
================

Oraclaestus uses a specific file format to define entity models and their behaviors. This is called the 'Model File'.
This file type is a specific file format described [here](model-file.md).

Modules
================
Oraclaestus provides basic functionalities through its standard modules.
These modules can registered in the simulation, and can be used by the entities.
- **[Logging Module](modules/log.md)**: Provides logging capabilities to entities.
- **[Maths module](modules/maths.md)**: Provides basic mathematical functions to entities.
